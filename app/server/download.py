"""
This script downloads a registered MLflow model artifact from the MLflow Model Registry
to a local directory, so it can be loaded and used without requiring a live MLflow server
at inference time.

Steps:
1. Configure MLflow tracking URI to point at the MLflow server.
2. Use the MLflow Artifacts API to fetch the model files for a given registry entry.
3. Print the local path where the model artifacts were saved.
